      "message": "Hello Jon.\n\nWe have foundother scenario where an update on the cifmw-dnsmasq is required:\n\n  $ cat /etc/cifmw-dnsmasq.d/addresses.conf\n  address\u003d/apps.ocp.openstack.lab/2620:cf:cf:cf02::3\n  address\u003d/rgw-external.ceph.local/2620:cf:cf:aaaa::2\n  \nTherefore, I wonder if we can update the tools role so we can pass the list of addresses and IPs that we want to add them. I did something pretty similar on https://review.gerrithub.io/c/shiftstack/shiftstack-qa/+/1197614/22/collection/tools/roles/tools_dnsmasq/README.md (Not sure if that helps, it\u0027s just an idea. I don\u0027t think a j2 is needed, but the zip is helpful to keep the mapping).\n\nWhat do you think?",
