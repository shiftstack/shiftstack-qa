      "message": "Hi Itay!\n\nI didn\u0027t finish the review. Just sharing with you my first thoughts:\n\n- Please update README.md with the idea you have to trigger the jobs. Jon will configure the pod to trigger the jobs and he needs to know the inputs: It\u0027s a playbook file and a configuration file, isn\u0027t it? Some explanation in the README will help. We are thinking to, instead of launching the pod with a sleep and then connect and run the commands, we can directly set the commands in the spec so the trigger will run until the automation is finished ;).\n\n- Next time we meet we need to work on configuring ansible-lint. It will help to identify the tasks that we are taking from the plugin that are not idempotent. I believe that trying to make all the tasks idempotent will help us a lot in the future.",
